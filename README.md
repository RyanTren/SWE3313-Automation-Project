### SWE3313-Automation-Project

Welcome to Group 1 Project Repository! This is the location of all artifacts, presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE3313 Project.

## What is our Software?
This project develops a computerized system to help restaurant personnel coordinate their
activities and improve their services, and for the management to track business growth and create
future plans.

This project computerizes restaurant operation so that all information pertaining to patron’s
orders and staff activity will be conveniently shared and stored over the restaurant’s intranet.
Hosts will be able to view table status with a click of a button. The wait staff will be able to enter
the patron’s orders quickly and efficiently and then have it electronically delivered to the
kitchen. The kitchen staff will be able to view the incoming orders and notify the proper wait
staff when the food is ready. Bus boys will be able to view real-time floor status allowing them
to know which tables are clean, dirty, or occupied.

## Project Goal
The goal for this project is to introduce automation in privately owned restaurants, that is, small-
to-medium sized establishments. Typical problems restaurant personnel are facing include:
* Coordination of their work activities
* Anticipating and handling periods of low/high patron traffic
* Recognizing trends early enough to take advantage of bestsellers or abandon the flops
* Lowering operating costs, and increasing efficiency/productivity and profits

## Features Our Team will be Implementing
Most importantly, all of the restaurant information is organized and saved for the management
viewing and archival. The analysis will consist of by-the-day and by-the-hour breakdowns of:
* Revenue and revenue percentage per menu item
* Menu item popularity
* Personnel efficiency
* Average turnaround time (how long patrons spend in the restaurant)
* Average preparation time (time from when the order is placed to when it is ready)
  
All data is automatically collected and processed allowing management to focus on analyzing the
data rather than calculating it.
